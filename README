How to install

In your project directory:

git submodule add https://github.com/kylerobson/KRKit.git

or just download the source and copy it into your project's directory

Drag the KRKit project file as a child under your project. Place it wherever you feel appropriate.

Adjust your project or target's settings:

Other Linker Flags: add "-ObjC"
Header Search Paths: add the path to KRKit, recursive... e.g. $(SRCROOT)/KRKit/**

On your target, add libKRKit.a to the "Link Binary With Libraries" build phase under the "Build Phases" tab
also on your target, add KRKit to the "Target Dependencies" build phase under the "Build Phases" tab (not sure if this is necessary)
